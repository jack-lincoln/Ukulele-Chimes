# Ukulele-Chimes
Ukulele Chimes uses pre-recorded musical notes played on a ukulele to replicate the randomness of wind chimes.

    •Play Chime - The notes of the current note set are played at random
    •Play Scale - The notes of the current note set are played as quarter notes in ascending order
    •Reset All - All settings are returned to their default state
    •Root Dial - Adjusts the root note of the current note set
    •Scale Combo Box - Select the scale used for the current note set
    •Mode Slider - Select the mode of the current scale
    •Drone Volume Sliders - Adjust the volume of the drone notes (based on the root and the fifth of the current note set)
    •Note Volume Sliders - Adjust the volume of each note. (While the scale is set to "Chromatic", adjusting the volume
        sliders may allow for user-created note sets when the "Play Chime" button is active.)

    •Keys 1-8 - For most scales, each note of the current note set may be played manually using these keys.
        If a scale has more than eight notes, keys 9, 0, -, =, and BACKSPACE are incorporated.
